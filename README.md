# Coding Patterns, DDD and Clean Code

Welcome to the Patterns in DDD repository! This repository is an extensive collection of coding patterns and best practices in C# and ASP.NET Core, emphasizing Domain Driven Design (DDD), Clean Code, and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Objective
Our primary goal is to provide a practical resource for developers who are looking to integrate DDD, Clean Code principles, and TDD in their C# and ASP.NET Core applications. This repository will serve both as a learning tool for new developers and a reference for experienced programmers.

## Contents
- **Domain Driven Design (DDD):** Strategies and patterns for effective domain modeling in C# and ASP.NET Core.
- **Clean Code:** Examples and guidelines for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code in C#.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** TDD practices and examples demonstrating how to write tests before coding features.

## Contributing 
Contributions are welcome! If you have a pattern, best practice, or example that aligns with the principles of DDD, Clean Code, or TDD in C# and ASP.NET Core, please feel free to contribute. See our contribution guidelines for more information.

## Usage
Each section in this repository is structured to provide both theoretical explanations and practical examples. You can navigate through different patterns and practices, and view code examples and explanations for each.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and we hope it serves as a valuable resource in your development journey!
